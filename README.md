# Resturant Review WebApp
---

## Project Overview

**Restaurant Reviews** project focuses on converting a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. A static design that lacks accessibility is fixed to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker is implemented to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Specification

* *Itâ€™s usable on a desktop browser.*
* *Good UI/UX on a mobile device.*
* *Must include any standard accessibility features.*
* *It should work offline for pages that have been visited.*

## Installation
To run the application:

1. Download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository onto your local workstation:
	* zip file [https://github.com/abbeyseto/Resturant-Review-App.zip](https://github.com/abbeyseto/Resturant-Review-App.zip "download zip file")
	* git clone [https://github.com/abbeyseto/Resturant-Review-App.git](https://github.com/abbeyseto/Resturant-Review-App.git/)
2. Open a browser window and navigate to the index.html file in your application's directory.

In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
